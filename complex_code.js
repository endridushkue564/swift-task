This code represents a digital book library system implemented in JavaScript. It consists of a User class, which handles user authentication, book searching, book borrowing, book returning, and book recommendations. The bookLibrary array stores book objects with their availability status and borrower information.

The User class has methods for login, logout, searching books by title, borrowing books, returning books, and recommending books. It also includes error handling for various scenarios, such as unavailable books, maximum borrowed books limit, and invalid book IDs.

The code includes comments to explain its functionality and improve readability. It is more than 200 lines long and demonstrates a complex system that can be executed.
